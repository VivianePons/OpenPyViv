Hi everybody, here I am, starting this blog: as if I did not have enough projects already. Anyway, after posting on twitter under [PyViv](https://twitter.com/PyViv) for the last 18 months or so, I felt that, sometimes, what I wanted to share did not fit in 140 characters. What am I going to talk about? Not sure yet... It will probably not be "hard science" in the sense of pure mathematical content (I have enough on my plate with my papers writing...). Even though, if I am particularly exited about some maths novelty, I might want to share! Anyway, most probably I will be talking on so called "soft subjects": what it feels like to be a researcher, what I think about this or that, feminism, community, teaching, tools, opinions, etc. And Well, let's see!
