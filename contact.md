If ever you need to contact me, you can write to my academic email [viviane.pons@lri.fr](mailto:viviane.pons@lri.fr). I am also on twitter under the name [PyViv](https://twitter.com/PyViv). Please, do not contact me if you're any kind of **marketing/ SEO company**, I don't sell links and this is a non commercial blog: I don't need your service, I won't answer you!

For those who have found some **grammar errors** or **misspelling** (be indulgent: English is not my first language!), please report or send me a pull request directly on the [blog source code](https://github.com/VivianePons/vivianepons.github.com).
