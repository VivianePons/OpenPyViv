I am a researcher in combinatorics and a associate professor in computer science at Universit√© Paris-Sud (Orsay). This blog reflects my own views on topics such as research, science, mathematics, programming and so on. More?

* My research is about [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) you can read more on my [academic home page](https://www.lri.fr/~pons/en/) or even read my research papers on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/pons_v_1).

* I teach basic computer science at undergrad level (programming, algorithmic,...) and also occasionally combinatorics, Sage, and other topics at all levels.

* I am an active user and contributor to the mathematical software [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) and an enthusiastic user of the platform [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/).

* I have a strong interest in the Python language and community and more generally in the OpenSource community, especially around science.

* I am part of the [OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/) project as a lead partner for Paris-Sud and in charge of the dissemination work package.

* If ever you read French, I also run a travel blog [VivianeVoyage](http://www.viviane-voyages.com/) where you can read different kind of stories.
